## üìù **NOTES**

### Current Status (What Works)
‚úÖ **Backend**
- Authentication system (JWT, password hashing)
- User registration and login
- **Product management COMPLETE** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with auth)
- Order CRUD operations (create, get, list, update, cancel)
- All 39 tests passing (14 product, 13 order, 12 user)

‚úÖ **Frontend**
- React Router setup with all pages
- Auth context and protected routes
- Login/Register pages
- Products listing page
- Shopping cart context and page
- Header with navigation

### Current Blockers
1. **No way to add products** - Admin product management must be implemented
2. **Checkout incomplete** - Need to finalize order submission flow
3. **No payment processing** - Stripe integration pending

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Remove unused `Request` parameter from GET /products endpoint
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexes
- [ ] Add request validation middleware

### Key Design Decisions
- **Admin Access**: For MVP, any authenticated user can manage products (add role system later)
- **Images**: Start with URL input for product images (proper upload in Phase 3)
- **Orders without Auth**: Keep orders authenticated (better for tracking and user experience)
- **Payment**: Build checkout flow first, add Stripe second (can test orders without payment)
