# Migration from Prisma to SQLAlchemy

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Vintage Store backend from Prisma ORM to SQLAlchemy with Alembic for database migrations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- Removed: `prisma = "^0.15.0"`
- Added: `alembic = "^1.14.0"`
- Kept: `sqlalchemy = "^2.0.43"`, `psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.10"`

### 2. Database Models (`app/models.py`)
Created SQLAlchemy models based on the original Prisma schema:
- `User` - Customer accounts
- `Product` - Vintage items
- `Order` - Customer purchases  
- `OrderItem` - Individual items in orders
- `OrderStatus` - Enum for order status

### 3. Database Configuration (`app/database_config.py`)
- Created synchronous SQLAlchemy engine and session management
- Environment variable support for DATABASE_URL
- Session factory for dependency injection

### 4. Database Service (`app/database.py`)
- Completely rewritten to use SQLAlchemy instead of Prisma
- All methods converted from async to sync (for simplicity)
- Maintains same API interface for compatibility
- Proper error handling and data conversion

### 5. API Endpoints (`app/main.py`)
- Updated product endpoints to use SQLAlchemy database service
- Updated user registration and login to use database
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API contracts

### 6. Database Migrations (`alembic/`)
- Initialized Alembic for database migrations
- Created initial migration with all tables and relationships
- Configured to work with PostgreSQL and environment variables

### 7. Testing (`tests/`)
- Updated test configuration to use in-memory SQLite for testing
- Created `conftest.py` with proper test database setup
- Updated test files to work with SQLAlchemy models
- Maintained all existing test cases

### 8. Cleanup
- Removed Prisma schema file and directory
- Removed Prisma dependencies from pyproject.toml

## Key Differences from Prisma

### 1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- Prisma: Async/await pattern
- SQLAlchemy: Synchronous operations (can be made async later if needed)

### 2. Query Building
- Prisma: Method chaining with `where`, `include`, etc.
- SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy Core expressions with `select()`, `where()`, etc.

### 3. Relationships
- Prisma: Automatic relationship loading with `include`
- SQLAlchemy: Explicit relationship loading with `selectinload()`

### 4. Migrations
- Prisma: `prisma migrate` commands
- SQLAlchemy: Alembic migrations with `alembic revision` and `alembic upgrade`

## Database Schema
The schema remains identical to the original Prisma schema:
- `users` table with email, names, password
- `products` table with name, description, price, category, images
- `orders` table with user_id, total_amount, status, shipping_address
- `order_items` table with order_id, product_id, quantity, price
- `OrderStatus` enum with PENDING, CONFIRMED, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED

## Running the Application

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
poetry install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/vintage_store"
```

### 3. Run Migrations
```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 5. Run Tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **More Control**: SQLAlchemy provides more granular control over queries
2. **Better Performance**: Can optimize queries more effectively
3. **Standard Python**: Uses standard Python patterns and libraries
4. **Flexibility**: Easier to customize and extend
5. **Mature Ecosystem**: Large community and extensive documentation

## Future Improvements

1. **Async Support**: Can add async SQLAlchemy support later if needed
2. **Connection Pooling**: Configure connection pooling for production
3. **Query Optimization**: Add database indexes and query optimization
4. **Caching**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Monitoring**: Add database query monitoring and logging
